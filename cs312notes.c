PC Hardware Overview
	Enclosure
	Motherboard
		
	CPU
	Random Access Memory
	Power Supply Unit
		Do not skip out on good PSU
	Drives

PC Standards:
	AT comes from the name of IBMs second gen PC. The IBM PC/AT (Advanced Technology)
	ATX = Extended
	BTX = Balanced Technology Extended

Stuff for the class
	HP Z230 Mobo
		8P8C connector
		4x USB 2
		2x USB 3
		Displayport

Busses  (omnibus): connects data from CPU, RAM, I/O
	CPU and RAM are tightly coupled, runs independently
	Old-school parallel busses reached their lmits interms of speed (difficulties of cross talk, timing skew, EMI, and power consumption)
	Serial busses dont have that problem.


PS/2 = Interrupt based (takes no CPU time)
USB  = Polling based (whatever ms it uses)


SDR - single data rate (old standard)
DDR - Double Data Rate 
	transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the oscillator-generated clock signal.
Power Supply Unit (PSU):
	ATX Specs:
		Voltages: +12V, +5V, +3.3V, low-power -12V (legacy), +5B(sb)

Partition (physical): 
	managed physical entity by the OS. 
File System (format): 
	Naming, addressing, metadata, storage of files/folders within a partition.
	OS cannot read a filesystem unless it has the drivers to do so.

Volume:
	A file storage location inside a file system. 
Mount Point:   
	Particular folder inside the booted OS where the volume files can be found.
Track:
	Ring of files in a disk
Sector:
	Minimum storage unit of a drive
	A single space (4096b - Advanced Format) in a Track.
Cluster (allocation unit):
	smallest amount of space the FS will use to store a file.
Slack space:
	the wasted space of a sector (10b used / 4KB cluster)
Fragmentation:
	files stored in multiple physically non-contiguous space. 
	still logically contiguous.

Disk Formatting:
mkfs -t ext3 -b 1024 -L LABLE /dev/sda1

Block:
	could mean anything depending on context.

//Containers
- You dont log into a container. 
- no need for boot or init. 
- does not emulate x86 processor like a vm so it is much faster.
- containers are instances of docker image. 
- cannot be distributed, images can be distributed.

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER //allows docker to be used by user

alpine: minimal OS to run docker on. 

docker images // to see what's installed
docker run $IMAGENAME $COMMANDS		//run commands directly.
docker run alpine cat /etc/os-release

docker ps -a // See all running/stopped containers.

// Run nginx webserver as a daemon, forward the port 80 to be displayed by 8080.
docker run --name web -d -p -8080:80 nginx:alpine  
docker stop web 	// kill it. 
docker restart web 		// same command as above, except save time.
docker stats 			// stats on the container like top command

docker container rm $CONTAINER_NAME // remove old container
docker image rm alpine:3.5			// remove the container itself.

// list of exited container, -Quiet (only display ID), -Filtered
docker ps -q -f status=exited 		
docker container rm $(docker ps -q -f status= exited) //get rid of all 
docker run --rm hello-world // kills the container after,.

docker run -it alpine sh // run sh inside alpine in interactive mode.
CTRL + P, CTRL + Q to get out
docker attach $CONTAINER_NAME // reattaches back to container.

Docker does not use glib-c
it also uses busybox as opposed to full set of utils.

apk -U add build-base gcc abuild binutils binutils-doc gcc-doc //install couple basics

curl -L // followthrough the redirect 

docker start -i webtest // continue where we left off.

dockerfiles -> setup script used to build a specific image.

Swarm manager is a server that manages the swarm.

Firewall originally started from engines in the car.
"Nobody is allowed, everyone is an enemy."

Firewall 
1. Rules
	permission to drive on the bridge
	incoming traffic addressed to registered/unused port is blocked.
	anti-lockout rule: allow port 80 in case the router breaks.
2. Network Address Translation (NAT)
	building the bridge
	allows port-forwarding for incoming connections.
	allows WAN to make first connection with LAN.
	Routers are normally built into the hardware, rather than software
	NAT is is enabled on internal routers but not needed.

10.0.x.x is internal, always dropped on the internet. 

wirespeed: is the device able to transmit data as it is receiving it? if so, no overhead.
"throw money at the problem is always the solution in IT"

NAT example:
1. host sends the header
	S: 10.0.0.1:3345	//random port
	D: 128.119.40.186:80
2. NAT router changes datagram source addr and updates table
	S: 138.76.29.7:5001 //5001 maps original Source
	D: 128.119.40.186:80
3. Reply arrives to NAT
	S: 128.119.40.186:80
	D: 138.76.29.7:5001
4. NAT changes the destination address back to orignal computer
	S: 128.119.40.186:80
	D: 10.0.0.1:3345	// yay mail.

before: static addresss will be useless outside the network. 
now: we use static address via mac address. 

NAT breaks VPN

Power and Ethernet crosses alternating currents.
WAP should be placed in center of the room 
Dont let metal block the way of WAP
Separate the channels from overlapping
5Ghz is weaker than 2.4GHz in range.

// Windows Active Directory (AD)
"Domain is like joining a country, except you can never ever leave... it's like North Korea. You'll get killed if you try to."


.com could point to a port 987 will be a share server. 
WiNS - Windows Naming Service (DNS but for local network)

You can pick a specific windows servers if you want. 
	just edit the DHCP or disable it. 
	Place a windows server contientiously. because it will take over everything.

PCs in certain domain will be subjected to Group Policies defined on that domain.
You will have to reinstall windows if you lost access to the domain.

// Certificate Authority (AD CS)
Group Policies controls who gets which certificates.

//Federation Services (AD FS)
Login services, authorization services
AKA OAuth
You use FS to login and gives you a token for site you are going for.

//Rights Management Services (AD RMS)
Built-in system for encrypting files and sets user permission.

Windows VM is good for gaming server, but not actually on the machine because needs graphic cards.

Server Manager, DHCP (can configure like regedit)

Objective for DevOps: not to get paged at 3 in the morning and get yelled at "you better fix this or you're fired"

SRE = Another word for DevOps (Site Reliability Engineering)

Telemetry: signal of health. (Heartbeat of your system)

SysAdmin questions:
	- How do you micro-manage these, and do you even want to?
	- If something is wrong with the particular machine, do you even care?
	- If you want to push an update, how do you do that to all of them?
	- And can you really type a few hundred commands thousands of times?
		- Active Directory
		- Chef and Puppet
		- get another job

// Configuration Management (CM)
Nowadays, just reinstalling the system is much faster than trying to find the drivers crashing. 


For example, we really want to just do this (Nightly example):
1. Spin up a Linux computer
2. Install the dependencies for the catsGifsNow service software
3. Download the catGifsNow Git repository''s source code
4. Build catGifsNow
5. Start the catGifsNow service
6. Add this instance of catGifsNow to our load balancer

CM / CM-like programs:
	- Chef
	- Puppet
	- Continuum and other Managed Provider Middleware
	- Ansible

Jenkins - automation server 

Chef, Puppet:
- Install a Daemon onto target system:
	- tracks the host state (packages, files, network connections, etc.)
	- Receives updates from the controller
	- Polls for updates every #min or #hour
	- They operate on "pull" model
		- installed agent checks for updates
		- performs those updates


Chef uses Ruby
Puppet uses Puppet config language.


Ansible (from Enders game)
	- operates on "push" model (less efficient).
		1. Controller has to evaluate the script given to it, 
		2. decide on the modules needed
		3. upload those modules
		4. run the commands
		5. then remove the modules.
	- could be set to "pull" model.
	- Do not need to maintain an agent install.
	- This is the mechanism, straight from the documentation:
"Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them. These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished."
	- You could tell ansible to target a state and install a MySQL and it will install it faster and efficiently than a human would.
	- Not a shell script, not a service or daemon. 
	- also does not monitor states. 

Goal of Automation:
	Remove human error
	Do things faster
	Reproducucibility: "No matter what, these exact things definitely work"
	Auto-remediation: "Did this daemon die? Here's how to restart it. Send me a text if that doesn't work, call me if doesn't work 3 times in a row"

// DevOps review
Dev Ops needs to worry about SLI, SLO, SLA:
	- Service Level Indicator: A quantitative measurement of a particular facet of a service: uptime, number hosts contacted, patches installed per hour, etc.
	- Service Level Objectives: A target value or range of values for an SLI
	- Service Level Agreement: The contractual agreement that specifies what SLOs we''re attempting to meet, and what happens when we meet, exceed, or fail to meet them.

salts are public information, if you have a dictionary, you can salt it differently with other dictionary words. 
$6$ // type of salt it was used.

head -n 1 /etc/shadow | cut -f 2 -d":" > pass
// first line of password, chop it to 2nd delimiter ":" and save to file "pass"

hashcat --help | grep "1800" // hash type specific to kali.

// Qualifications:

leadership skills (imperative)
	needs "nerds with personalities."

Visionary (crutial)

Project Management skills (critical)

Deep understanding of -- and the abaility to directly relate to -- our business (critical)
	design functionality - design flow (needs to make sure UI works best)

Understanding of corporate finance (important)

Public speaking is (Required)
	They wanna know if you have a degree or not (doesn't matter which degree') for management level 
		(because public image)
		experience > degree 
		being able to communicate > delivery (back up what you say)


In a small organization, you're gonna get exposed to more stuff a lot quicker.'
If you're chasing for money, you need to go big, less job.'

"You're not gonna get to a room first thing in the morning an flip the light switch and call the electric company to thank them. You're only gonna get calls only when there's a problem." 

Look at the entire package before signing for jobs. 
	401k 401k match
	mileage imbursement
	high vs low deductable
	health care (dental? vision?)
	roll-over leftover unused plans
	In the management track, higher income, but less job oppertunity since they'll likely to hire from within.'
