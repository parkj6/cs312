PC Hardware Overview
    Enclosure
    Motherboard
        
    CPU
    Random Access Memory
    Power Supply Unit
        Do not skip out on good PSU
    Drives

PC Standards:
    AT comes from the name of IBMs second gen PC. The IBM PC/AT (Advanced Technology)
    ATX = Extended
    BTX = Balanced Technology Extended

Stuff for the class
    HP Z230 Mobo
        8P8C connector
        4x USB 2
        2x USB 3
        Displayport

Busses  (omnibus): connects data from CPU, RAM, I/O
    CPU and RAM are tightly coupled, runs independently
    Old-school parallel busses reached their lmits interms of speed (difficulties of cross talk, timing skew, EMI, and power consumption)
    Serial busses dont have that problem.


PS/2 = Interrupt based (takes no CPU time)
USB  = Polling based (whatever ms it uses)


SDR - single data rate (old standard)
DDR - Double Data Rate 
    transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the oscillator-generated clock signal.
Power Supply Unit (PSU):
    ATX Specs:
        Voltages: +12V, +5V, +3.3V, low-power -12V (legacy), +5B(sb)

Partition (physical): 
    managed physical entity by the OS. 
File System (format): 
    Naming, addressing, metadata, storage of files/folders within a partition.
    OS cannot read a filesystem unless it has the drivers to do so.

Volume:
    A file storage location inside a file system. 
Mount Point:   
    Particular folder inside the booted OS where the volume files can be found.
Track:
    Ring of files in a disk
Sector:
    Minimum storage unit of a drive
    A single space (4096b - Advanced Format) in a Track.
Cluster (allocation unit):
    smallest amount of space the FS will use to store a file.
Slack space:
    the wasted space of a sector (10b used / 4KB cluster)
Fragmentation:
    files stored in multiple physically non-contiguous space. 
    still logically contiguous.

Disk Formatting:
mkfs -t ext3 -b 1024 -L LABLE /dev/sda1

Block:
    could mean anything depending on context.
	1. Sector on a disk.
	2.
