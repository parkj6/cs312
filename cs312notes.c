PC Hardware Overview
	Enclosure
	Motherboard
		
	CPU
	Random Access Memory
	Power Supply Unit
		Do not skip out on good PSU
	Drives

PC Standards:
	AT comes from the name of IBMs second gen PC. The IBM PC/AT (Advanced Technology)
	ATX = Extended
	BTX = Balanced Technology Extended

Stuff for the class
	HP Z230 Mobo
		8P8C connector
		4x USB 2
		2x USB 3
		Displayport

Busses  (omnibus): connects data from CPU, RAM, I/O
	CPU and RAM are tightly coupled, runs independently
	Old-school parallel busses reached their lmits interms of speed (difficulties of cross talk, timing skew, EMI, and power consumption)
	Serial busses dont have that problem.


PS/2 = Interrupt based (takes no CPU time)
USB  = Polling based (whatever ms it uses)


SDR - single data rate (old standard)
DDR - Double Data Rate 
	transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the oscillator-generated clock signal.
Power Supply Unit (PSU):
	ATX Specs:
		Voltages: +12V, +5V, +3.3V, low-power -12V (legacy), +5B(sb)

For the purpose of this class, "Hard drives" are magnetic and "SSD" are all flash memories including USB.

OEM: Original Equipment Manufacturer.

// Drives logistics.
Partition (physical): 
	managed physical entity by the OS. 
File System (format): 
	Naming, addressing, metadata, storage of files/folders within a partition.
	OS cannot read a filesystem unless it has the drivers to do so.

Volume:
	A file storage location inside a file system. 
Mount Point:   
	Particular folder inside the booted OS where the volume files can be found.
Track:
	Ring of files in a disk
Sector:
	Minimum storage unit of a drive
	A single space (4096b - Advanced Format) in a Track.
Cluster (allocation unit):
	smallest amount of space the FS will use to store a file.
Slack space:
	the wasted space of a sector (10b used / 4KB cluster)
Fragmentation:
	files stored in multiple physically non-contiguous space. 
	still logically contiguous.

Disk Formatting:
mkfs -t ext3 -b 1024 -L LABLE /dev/sda1

Block:
	could mean anything depending on context.
	1. Sector on a disk.
	2.
