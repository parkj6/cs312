Instructions:

1. Open pfSense VM and wait for it to load.

2. Once it's loaded, open the "CentOS_CLI" VM and 4 "Alpine" VM for testing.

3. On the CentOS_CLI, download and unzip the "parkj6-hw7.zip" file 
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkj6/cs312/master/HW7/parkj6-hw7.zip > hw7.zip
	sudo yum install -y unzip
	unzip hw7.zip -d hw7

4. run "ip addr" on alpine machines to verify* that their address are:
192.168.1.21
192.168.1.22
192.168.1.23
192.168.1.24
	*if they aren't assigned these addresses, the script file "hw7script.sh" and "hosts.ini" needs to change to match the address of the 4 Alpine VM machines.
	
5. run the hw7script.sh by typing "./hw7script.sh" on to CentOS_CLI

6. type "password" 4 times for each of the Alpine VM's password prompt.

7. Sip your coffee/tea/water and give Jong 100% on the assignment + whatever extra credit you think he deserves.
