Lab Questions
1) What are some differences between GPT and MBR-style partition tables? (3 points)
	Master Boot Records (MBR) uses the standard BIOS partition table (old style).
	GUID Partition Table (GPT) uses the new Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) (new).
	One advantage over GPT is that it can have more than 4 primary partitions.
	GPT can handle disks larger than 2 TB whereas MBR cant.
	GPT use replication and cyclical redundancy check (CRC) protection of the partition table.
	In GPT, platform operation data are located in partitions. 
	In MBR, platform operation data are located in unpartitioned or hidden sectors.
